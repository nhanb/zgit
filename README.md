My first serious Zig exercise.

The plan is to eventually develop a self-hosted git forge that's reasonably
simple to operate.

# Drawing board

## Stretch goal: allow contributing without creating account

Very good suggestion:
<https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/13442#issuecomment-724990741>

> 1. Allow the option to create a PR from a patch generated by git format-patch, if users prefer that over creating and cloning a fork.
> 2. In email notifications for new PRs, attach the patch to the email as if it was sent by git send-email so the maintainer can apply the patch like they normally would.
> 3. Allow users to reply to notification emails and have those replies show up in the web interface. GitHub already does this.
> 4. Allow creating PRs by sending an email using git send-email

For now let's focus on self contained development though.
